# sonic_hack
A modification of sonic the hedgehog 2 for research/entertainment purposes

## To Do:

### Bug List:
- General Collision Bugs
- Fix Tails' Tails
- Fix Knuckles Climbing (as well as when he comes out of debug mode)
- Fix Bubble Shield
- Bubbles spawning better

### Feature List:
- Update all objects code and take any objects not spawned in layout off the list (and change their names)
- Update all objects code to new format as well as update object loading
- Seperate all level data to make it easy to add new levels and update it so each act gets its own information (art, layout, ect...)
- Try to make all object coding faster/more efficient if possible (such as animate object ect...)
- New faster compression format
- Faster way to load art
- Implement "Tile, Block, Chunk and Section" system
