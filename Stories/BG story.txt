BG Story:
	Right after the death egg was destroyed, Sonic and Tails went off to a distant island for
a long deserved vacation from stopping robotnik and his evil plan. One day, very loud explosions 
were heard coming from a distant jungle island. Sonic and Tails decided to go find out 
what was going on. Meanwhile, on Angel Island, Knuckles had been going around fixing the damage
caused by Dr. Robotnik. When everything was almost finished, he heard the explosions as well.
He knew there was more to do on his island, but such loud explosions could mean harm for Angel
Island as well, he knew whatever it was should probably be stopped before it found its way to
his home. As all three heroes got close to the island, they saw each other and decided to go together.
Soon after reaching the outskirts of the island, they were ambushed by a few eggrobos. They 
then knew what was going on. After quickly destroying the devious robots, they decided that they 
needed to find out what Dr. Robotnik was up to in this huge area, and so, they started their 
adventure...
